# Purpose

This package is intended to ease reliability analysis using the Weibull distribution, which is the most common method of reliability analysis.  Check out the [documentation](http://weibull.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more information!

# Project Maturity

I am making every effort to ensure that every release is technically sound; however, it is possible that something is technically incorrect!  It is up to the user to verify functionality for themselves.

In addition, the interface is still maturing as I run it through different use cases and there will likely be breaking changes until the 1.0 release.  There will not be any breaking changes until major release numbers after that.

Most of the functionality is backed up by tests with the exception of plotting functionality.

# Contributions

Initial work on this repository was done by user [tgray](https://github.com/tgray).  You can still peruse the [original repository](https://github.com/tgray/weibull).

It would be highly useful to have different estimation methods and confidence bounds within the `Analysis` class.  If you are feeling froggy, please, submit your pull request!
