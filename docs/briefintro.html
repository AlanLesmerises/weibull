<div class="section" id="weibull-distribution">
<h2>Weibull Distribution<a class="headerlink" href="#weibull-distribution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In reliability analysis and, thus, in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">weibull</span></code> package, we are primarily concerned with the 2-parameter Weibull probability density function defined herein as:</p>
<div class="math">
\[F(x) = \frac{\beta}{\eta} \left(\frac{x}{\eta}\right)^{\beta-1} e^{-\left(x/\eta\right)^\beta}\]</div>
<p>where:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> or <em>beta</em> represents the <strong>shape</strong> parameter</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\eta\)</span> or <em>eta</em> represents the <strong>scale</strong> parameter</li>
<li><span class="math">\(x\)</span> represents the value at which the function is to be evaluated</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Were one to plot the above <span class="math">\(F(x)\)</span> with given <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\eta\)</span> values, one would get the probability density function, commonly shortened to PDF.  From the PDF alone, it is possible to derive the cumulative distribution function (a.k.a CDF and hazard functions), along wih the survival function which is very useful in reliability engineering.</p>
<div class="section" id="distribution-shape">
<h3>Distribution Shape<a class="headerlink" href="#distribution-shape" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>shape</strong> parameter, <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span>, determines the overall shape of the distribution.  There are three primary regions in which <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> may fall:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(\beta &lt; 1.0\)</span> Indicates infant mortality, or decreasing failures as time increases.  This is a distribution that may be observed when a phenomenon such as adhesive curing exists. As the adhesive cures, the product experiences fewer failures.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta = 1.0\)</span> Indicates ‘random’ or ‘constant’ failures.  This sort of distribution is most commonly applied to some electronic component categories, such as semiconductors.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta &gt; 1.0\)</span> Indicates a wearout style of distribution.  This distribution is commonly observed on elements such as bearings which will increase their failure rate as wear increases.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<img alt="_images/beta-effects-on-pdf.png" src="_images/beta-effects-on-pdf.png" />
<p>It is possible for a product to exhibit all three of these characteristics on different components.  Imagine a car which has adhesives, electronics, and bearings, each of which have their own failure distributions.  With careful analysis of the failure modes, it is possible to determine the individual component failure distributions, which allows the designer to potentially identify and resolve the most problematic elements of the design first.</p>
<img alt="_images/beta-effects-on-fr.png" src="_images/beta-effects-on-fr.png" />
<p>It is the combination of these three potentially different <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> characteristics that gives rise to the traditional bathtub curve commonly observed in reliability analysis.  Looking closely at the plot of failure rates, one can see that a product composed of three different <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> characteristic components could begin to form an overall bathtub curve of the composite failure rates.</p>
<img alt="_images/bathtub-components.png" src="_images/bathtub-components.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="distribution-scale">
<h3>Distribution Scale<a class="headerlink" href="#distribution-scale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>scale</strong> parameter, <span class="math">\(\eta\)</span>, determines the scale of the distribution.  This parameter is also known as the <em>characteristic life</em> of the product and corresponds to the cycles at which 63% of the product has failed.</p>
<img alt="_images/eta-effects-on-pdf.png" src="_images/eta-effects-on-pdf.png" />
<p>Note that changes in the scale factor keep the shape, but effectively change the length over which the distribution is ‘stretched’.  The hange in height is due to the property that the area under the curve must always be equal to 1.0.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="censoring-data">
<h2>Censoring Data<a class="headerlink" href="#censoring-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For the reliability engineer, there are three possible scenarios for a batch of units:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>All units are running with no failures</li>
<li>Some units have failed, but not all OR test was stopped before all units failed (right-censored)</li>
<li>All units have failed (not censored, or ‘complete’ data)</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Weibull distribution can handle scenarios 2 and 3 well, but failures are inherently part of the equation.  If there are no failures, the best that can be expected is a lower estimate for the life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="determining-and">
<h2>Determining <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\eta\)</span><a class="headerlink" href="#determining-and" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first task of the reliability engineer is to determine suitable values for <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\eta\)</span>.  The two most common options are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>plot the points on Weibull paper, approximate a line, determine the slope and characteristic life</li>
<li>maximum likelihood estimate (MLE)</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In general, if only a small number of data points are available, then the approximation using Weibull paper or its equivalent will generate good results.  If there is a relatively large body of data available, then MLE methods are preferred.  Both methods will generally give acceptable results, assuming that the Weibull distribution adequately describes the process.</p>
<p>Currently, this package uses only the linear regression technique for estimating <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\eta\)</span>, although it may support the MLE method in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="b-life">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>B-Life<a class="headerlink" href="#b-life" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A common and effective method for specifying the life of a product is to specify the time when a certain portion of the units are expected to experience failure.  This is often called the B-life of a product where B is followed by the number which specifies the percent of units failed.  For instance, if one were to say that the B10 life of a product were 100 hours, then it would be expected that 10% of all units will have failed at 100 hours.</p>
